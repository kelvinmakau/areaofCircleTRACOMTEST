# areaofcircleTRACOM_TEST
A Part of The Tracom Academy Interview to Test basic coding skills

It's a simple program for finding the area of a circle(my shape of choice)
It requests for input from the user(the redius of the circle strictly in numbers) and gives an output of the computed Area.

It imports the module math to be able to use the pi method instead of implictly declaring pi to be 3.14 which is not the most accurate
